# Pulmonary lower zone fibrosis

*From a lecture by Dr. Miranda Siemienowicz.*

The most common cause of reticulation in the lower zones is the consequence of previous infection, aspiration, recurrent aspiration. Things you might see: A few bands in the lower lobes, a little bit of dilated airways. 


When you’re reporting fibrotic lung disease you’re trying to categorise into one of three categories. This categorization is important for the managing pysicians. 


*  definite [\<UIP\>](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=radiopaedia+article+usual+interstitial+pneumonia)
* 'possible UIP' = everything but honeycombing
* 'inconsistent with UIP' = upper zones, ground-glass, air trapping, peribronchovascular, micronodules, cysts, consolidation


> "When you’ve got something that’s either a possible UIP or inconsistent with UIP, you want to see if you can take the next step and suggest another category of pattern. Categorize the pattern, don't guess the disease. 
> 
> In those second two columns of possible and inconsistent we want to see if we can go the next step further, we want to see if we have any features that are going to point to something like NSIP as the underlying pattern."



## Usual interstitial pneumonia

- basal, subpleural / peripheral predominance
- [\<reticulation\>](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=radiopaedia+article+reticular+interstitial+pattern) (sometimes coarse)
- traction bronchiectasis (**definition:** Abnormally dilated, irregular airways that are surrounded by abnormal lung)
- honeycombing (**definition:** Sub-pleural lucencies that have well defined walls,that share walls and often layered back from the pleura in multiple rows)
- no 'inconsistent' features

> "We’ve got that definite honeycombing, the report is usual interstitial pneumonia pattern fibrotic lung disease."
