# Pulmonary Upper Zone Fibrosis

*From a lecture by Dr. Miranda Siemienowicz.*

## Sarcoidosis 

* bilateral upper lung volume loss
* perilymphatic distribution of nodules with upper zone fibrosis
* numerous lymph nodes mediastinal and perihilar, partially calified
* elevated serum ACE level


## Silicosis

* similar to the sarcoidosis signs
* much more likely to calcify in the parenchyma than sarcoidosis


## Chronic hypersensitive pneumonitis

* symmetrical upper zone fibrosis
* fine reticulation
* traction bronchiectasis with irregular airways
* peribronchovascular distribution (abnormal parenchyma is extending along the bronchovascular bundles)
* mosaic appearanc of lungs
* [\<air trapping\>](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=radiopaedia+article+air+trapping)

Air trapping, normal lung and ground glass -> triple density appearance ('head cheese').


## postprimary or reactivation tuberculosis

- asymmetrical upper zone fibrosis
- a bit consolidation
- cavities
- centrilobular ground glass nodules
- tree in bud

> "Consolidation, cavities and tree in bud endobronchial spread are the three features on a single image that are suggestive of active infection. 
>
> You want to see stability over 6 months to give an indication that the infection is inactive."
