# Pulmonary Nodule Patterns

### Three types of distribution patterns

####  Centrilobular 
* Involvement of the central lobular structures (terminal bronchiole, pulmonary artery and acini). **No pleural involvement** (pathology can't reach the septal lymphatic structures). Found in airway inflammation, endobronchial spread of infection or malignancy.

##### Example
* Subacute Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (pulmonary disorders mediated by an inflammatory reaction to inhalation of an organic allergen).
    * peribronchial non-necrotising granulomas (ground glass)
	* bronchiolocentric cellurar aveolar wall infiltrate

* Respiratory Bronchiolitis 
    * Macrophage-filled respiratory bronchioles
	* Bronchial wall inflammation

* Tree in bud pattern. Per definition the "tree" is the terminal bronchiole, the buds are the acini that are filled with secretion (initially described in patients with endobronchial tuberculosis). 
    * Either sterile of infectious secretion. 
	* Infectious bronchiolitis 

* Multifocal spread of lung adenocarcinoma.


####  Perilymphatic
Because the septal distribution the **pleura is by definition involved**.

##### Example
* Sarcoidosis

* Progressive massive fibrosis (if it's beginning to conglomerate), late stage of several diseases.

* Lymphanginitis carcinomatosa (possible with central hilar lung cancer), if cental cancer and regional septal thickening without the nodules **regional venous congestion** is differential.


####  Random (= better uniform)
Pathology that relates to the capillary bed. So haematogenous (miliary) seeding of infection or metastases.

##### Example
* Miliary tuberculosis

* Multiple metastasis typically from hypervasicular carcinomas (melanoma, renal, thyroid, choriocarcinoma)
