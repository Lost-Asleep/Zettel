# Lung Adenocarcinoma Terminology

*From a lecture by Dr. Miranda Siemienowicz.*

In 2011, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), American Thoracic Society (ATS), and European Respiratory Society (ERS) introduced a new classification and terminology for adenocarcinoma of the lung. 

* Non smoker cancer. 


### Has a broad pathological spectrum

* AAH: atypical adenomatous hyperplasia

* AIS: adenocarcinoma in situ

* MIA: minimally invasive adenocarcinoma

* LPA: lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma of the lung (formerly non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC)). Already invasive (I think). Lepidic growth is a pathological term referring to a pattern of cell proliferation along the lining of the alveolar structures of the lung as is seen in a subset of lung tumours.

* IA: invasive adenocarcinoma
