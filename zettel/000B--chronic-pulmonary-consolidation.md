# Chronic pulmonary consolidation

Inflammatory vs Malignant

## Organizing Pneumonia

* **migratory opacities**
* **not responding to antibiotics**
* peripheral regions of geographic consolidation
* lower zone predominance
* atoll or [\<reversed halo sign\>](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=radiopaedia+article+reversed+halo+sign+lungs)
* **perilobular distribution** / alveolar septal inflammation (some secondary nodules are outlined by consolidation)
* plugs of granulation / fibrous tissue filling bronchioles

[\<Organizing pneumonia\>](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=radiopaedia+article+organizing+pneumonia) is the stereotypical responses of the lung to any kind of insult. It can be idiopathic, the so called [\<Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia\>](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=radiopaedia+article+cryptogenic+organizing+pneumonia), but it can also be seen as result of inciting infection (e.g. a viral prodrome before the abnormalities). It can be seen in the setting of autoimmune disease, connective tissue diseases (e.g. [\<dermatomyositis\>](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wikipedia+dermatomyositis+DM), [\<polymyositis\>](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wikipedia+polymyositis+encyclopedia)). Most (especially cryptogenic forms) respond very well to corticosteroid treatment. 


## Chronic eosinophilic Pneumonia

* migratory consolidations
* **not responding to antibiotics**
* also regional consolidations
* a bit more upper zone predominance
* history of asthma (50 % of patients)
* *peripheral eosinophilia in blood panel*


## Central obstructing tumor (lung cancer)

* also not responding to antibiotics
* enlarged lymph nodes (paratracheal, perihilar) -> *the only infection that usually gives lymphadenopathy in adults is tuberculosis.*
* Abrupt terminating bronchus (by tumor) -> leads to 'drowned lung' appearance


## Or the malignancy itself causes the consolidated appearance (lung adenocarcinoma)

* Consolidation and ground glass 
* Maybe more centrilubular ground glass nodules in another or multiple lobes

### lung adenocarcinoma

* localized = solitary soft tissue mass
* multifocal = multiple ground glass nodules
* pneumonic = consolidation
