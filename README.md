# Zettel

Just bits and pieces of information I stumble across. I will try to keep links to the original sources. This file will also be the main index. I am still wondering about the basic structure. For now I will just throw all markdown files into the main directory. Maybe I will add special directories for images and such. 


### File names
The files will be named continuously with 4 characters [0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ] two dashes and a more meaningful title. So the first note will be named `0000--basic-markdown.md` and the last one `ZZZZ--some-note-name.md`. This naming scheme leaves me with 1679616 possible combinations. Should be more than enough.
